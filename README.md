### About me 
After backpacking around 30 countries, I realized that technology and computer science are taking over the world. Everyone is looking for the newest developments and with them comes the creativeness and valuable tools. I want to be part of the technology evolution to help shape the world into a more modern and productive environment or at the very least, understand the concept of this digital world that the future will soon mostly be built on.
